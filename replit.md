# Advanced Multilingual Multimodal Medical AI System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Streamlit-based multilingual multimodal medical AI system that addresses the critical challenge of early and accurate disease identification in multilingual communities. The system specifically targets neuropsychiatric and metabolic diseases (depression, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism) through advanced analysis of facial micro-expressions and speech paralinguistics (prosody, fluency, lexical content) in both English and Telugu speakers. The application integrates cutting-edge technologies including Whisper for multilingual speech recognition, DeepFace for facial micro-expression analysis, and fusion deep learning models combining CNN and LSTM/GRU architectures. The system overcomes current AI diagnostic limitations by supporting multilingual data and leveraging the additive potential of multimodal behavioral conditions. This addresses the significant healthcare challenge where subjective symptom reporting and language limitations make clinical assessment difficult in multilingual communities.
