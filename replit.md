# Advanced Multilingual Multimodal Medical AI System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Streamlit-based web application that provides state-of-the-art AI-powered medical diagnostic assistance through advanced multimodal analysis. The system integrates cutting-edge technologies including Whisper for speech recognition, DeepFace for facial emotion analysis, multilingual translation, text-to-speech output, and fusion deep learning models combining CNN and LSTM/GRU architectures. The application supports multilingual operation (English, Telugu, Hindi, Tamil) and can detect neuropsychiatric and metabolic diseases including depression, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism from webcam-recorded videos by analyzing both facial micro-expressions and speech features (prosody, fluency, lexical content). The system emphasizes that it's for research and demonstration purposes only and should not replace professional medical consultation.
